# Simple Sails Chatroom
**Stability: 1 - Experimental**

## Description
SimpleSailsChatroom is a small chatroom application that take advantage of the [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) framework. It uses [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) to do real-time communication between users.

This project is just a proof of concept and had to be done in less than a day. Therefor, there is still a lot to do before deploying SimpleSailsChatroom to production.

## Dev
**You'll need a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database running to launch SimpleSailsChatroom.**
*However*, you can switch to a few others datastores such as MySQL or Postgre thanks to the [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) ORM.

### Commands
* Init: `npm install`
* Run: `npm start`
